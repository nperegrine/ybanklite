## Description
This repository contains the improved yBank web and api code for the Test Assignment

The following key considerations where taken into account when working on this improved Test Assignment:

* **Security** - Prevent app from being hacked.
* **Best Practices** - Applied SOLID principles, re-wrote and refactored code to ensure it is cleaner and easier to maintain.
* **Documentation** - Provided information on how to setup the project.
* **Tests** -  Implemented more than a dozen Feature and Unit tests.
* **Logic** - Prevented overspending of account balance

## Appreciation
I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work on the test assignment. When coding this improved version, I attempted to implement the SOLID design principles and a few other Software Design best practices taking into deep consideration the fact that I was working on a banking platform.
